    <div class="aboutText">
        I will go ahead and address the question you are probably asking yourself right now. What is a "MataGrub"? 
        I keyed the term from my all time favorite video game Half-life. In the summer of 1998 scientists create 
         a void that opens up to other dimensions. This in effect gives a master alien race known as the 
        Combine an opportunity to invade earth. Leader of the project that caused the chaotic event, Wallace Breen, 
        manages to negotiate humanities surrender after the Combine takes control of earth in just seven hours. As 
        a "reward" for humanities surrender, Breen is given the position of ruler of the world. This sparks lots of 
        conflict with the human race and Breen. As a large majority of human kind including the protagonist for most 
        of the game is convinced Breen made this decision completelly out of greed and selfishness. Later in the story 
        Breen manages to convince the alien race to transition his body into an intelligent species of creature known 
        as the shu'ulathoi. Shu'ulathoi are grub like creatures that have no limbs similar to a snail. Although these 
        creatures lack a proper physical appearance they make up for it with unfathomable intellegence. Affectively 
        renaming Wallace Breen into "BreenGrub". BreenGrub uses his new intellegence to help the human race in the unrise by
        telepathically sending signals to the resistance with information about the Combines weaknesses.<br><br>

        I resonate deeply with the BreenGrub story. It might seem silly because Breen is just a video game character, 
        but I feel like Wallace Breen represents so much more in life than just a made up character. Being misunderstood, 
        feeling lost, feeling unsure when no one sees your side, and of course the tough choices you have to make 
        in life you dont want to. I want MataGrub to be a messenger just like Wallace Breen was at the end of his days. 
        I want to inspire and install hope in people who are in doubt. Not long ago I was lost too. I didn't even know 
        I had an interest in computers. Today I'm happy to say that I LOVE the work I do, and I want MataGrub to give
        you that same hope as well.<br><br>
        
        If you made it this far into my rambles I want to thank you for taking time out of your day to read. MataGrub 
        is a reminder for anyone reading that it's okay to be lost, and it's okay to not 
        understand your place in this very moment. Do the things that you love, and do the things that peak your 
        interests but do them in a productive manner!<br><br>
