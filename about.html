I will go ahead and address the question you are probably asking yourself right now. What is a "MataGrub"? 
I keyed the term from my all time favorite video game "Half-life". In the summer of 1998 a cataclysmic event that 
rips open a void giving a master alien race known as the "Combine" an opportunity to invade earth. 
Scientist and leader of the project that caused the chaotic event, Wallace Breen, manages 
to negotiate humanities 
surrender after the Combine takes control of earth in just seven hours. As a "reward" for humanities surrender, 
Breen is given the 
position of ruler of the world. This sparks lots of conflict 
with the human race and Breen. As a large majority of human kind including the protagonist for most of the 
game is convinced Breen made this decision completelly out of greed and selfishness. 
Later in the story Breen manages to convince the alien race to transition his body 
into creature known as the shu'ulathoi. Shu'ulathoi are grub like creatures that have no limbs similar to a snail. 
Although these creatures lack a proper physical appearance they make up for it with unfathomable intellegence. 
Affectively renaming Wallace Breen into "BreenGrub". Breen in turn uses this power to help the humans in the unrise by
telepathically sending signals to the resistance with information about the combines weaknesses. 

I resonate deeply with the BreenGrub story. It might seem silly because Breen is just a video game character, 
but for me, I have faced many of those similar feelings I'm sure Breen went through. Being 
misunderstood, feeling lost, the lonely feeling you get when no one sees your side, and of course the tough choices 
you have to make in life you dont want to. I want MataGrub to be a messenger just like Wallace Breen was at the end of 
his days. I want to inspire and install hope in people who are in doubt. Not long ago I was just some human, lost, scared,
and confused with obsicles presented to me by life. I did not know I even had an interest in computers, I cared little 
to get to know them just up until a little while ago. I wanted a military life. Nothing more. But life is good 
at throwing curve balls, and due to some surgeries I had in my leg I was unable to get in. I was shattered.
Probably still a bit shattered to this day. But I like to tell myself that is where the joureny started. It took about
two years, but the weirdest thing happens to me in this two year limbo. 

I've never liked books growing up. The only reading I ever did was comic books (quick s/o to my boy
Kang the Conquerer). There is nothing more unattractive to me than a thick dictionary looking book with no pictures.
Well, this is exactly the kind of book I run into one day at a give away in some library. 
The book was titled "HTML and CSS Fundamentals" I flipped threw the pages and thought "hey! this is what hackers do!". 
Interestingly, I read the book. Somehow, I got myself to read cover to cover, 
and something clicked that day. It was a good feeling but also a feeling leaving me wanting more. And just like 
that my joureny in coding begun.

Fast forward to today, I have now completed a full stack coding bootcamp from University of Texas in
San Antonio. I stay curious and try to understand the deeper meaning of everything around us.
Dedicated to continuous learning, and love building things with JavaScript, React, and Python. I stand above my
problems and do my best to solve them. 

If you made it this far into my rambles I want to thank you for taking time out of your day to read. It wasn't 
easy writing these stories of my past, but I want my stories & MataGrub to be a reminder for anyone reading that it's 
okay to be lost, 
and it's okay to not understand your place in this very moment. Do the things that you love. Do the things that peak
your interests but do them in a productive manner! Thank you for checking out MataGrub! If you are interested in 
contacting me for work or help of any sorts, please feel free to CoNtAcT me.
