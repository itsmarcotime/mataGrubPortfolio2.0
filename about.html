        I will go ahead and address the question you are probably asking yourself right now<span class='green'>.</span> What is a <span class='green'>"</span>MataGrub<span class='green'>"</span><span class='green'>?</span> 
        I keyed the term from my all time favorite video game <span class='green'>"</span>Half-life<span class='green'>"</span><span class='green'>.</span> In the summer of 1998 scientists create 
         a void that opens up to other dimensions<span class='green'>.</span> This in turn gives a master alien race known as the 
        <span class='green'>"</span>Combine<span class='green'>"</span> an opportunity to invade earth<span class='green'>.</span> Leader of the project that caused the chaotic event<span class='green'>,</span> Wallace Breen<span class='green'>,</span> 
        manages to negotiate humanities surrender after the Combine takes control of earth in just seven hours<span class='green'>.</span> As 
        a <span class='green'>"</span>reward<span class='green'>"</span> for humanities surrender<span class='green'>,</span> Breen is given the position of ruler of the world<span class='green'>.</span> This sparks lots of 
        conflict with the human race and Breen<span class='green'>.</span> As a large majority of human kind including the protagonist for most 
        of the game is convinced Breen made this decision completelly out of greed and selfishness<span class='green'>.</span> Later in the story 
        Breen manages to convince the alien race to transition his body into an intelligent species of creature known 
        as the shu<span class='green'>'</span>ulathoi<span class='green'>.</span> Shu<span class='green'>'</span>ulathoi are grub like creatures that have no limbs similar to a snail<span class='green'>.</span> Although these 
        creatures lack a proper physical appearance they make up for it with unfathomable intellegence<span class='green'>.</span> Affectively 
        renaming Wallace Breen into <span class='green'>"</span>BreenGrub<span class='green'>"</span><span class='green'>.</span> BreenGrub uses his new intellegence to help the humans in the unrise by
        telepathically sending signals to the resistance with information about the Combines weaknesses<span class='green'>.</span><br><br>

        I resonate deeply with the BreenGrub story<span class='green'>.</span> It might seem silly because Breen is just a video game character<span class='green'>,</span> 
        but I feel like Wallace Breen represents so much more in life than just a made up character<span class='green'>.</span> Being misunderstood<span class='green'>,</span> 
        feeling lost<span class='green'>,</span> feeling unsure when no one sees your side<span class='green'>,</span> and of course the tough choices you have to make 
        in life you dont want to<span class='green'>.</span> I want MataGrub to be a messenger just like Wallace Breen was at the end of his days<span class='green'>.</span> 
        I want to inspire and install hope in people who are in doubt<span class='green'>.</span> Not long ago I was lost too<span class='green'>.</span> I didn't even know 
        I had an interest in computers<span class='green'>.</span> Today I<span class='green'>'</span>m happy to say that I LOVE the work I do<span class='green'>,</span> and I want MataGrub to give
        you that same hope as well<span class='green'>.</span><br><br>
        
        If you made it this far into my rambles I want to thank you for taking time out of your day to read<span class='green'>.</span> MataGrub 
        is a reminder for anyone reading that it<span class='green'>'</span>s okay to be lost<span class='green'>,</span> and it<span class='green'>'</span>s okay to not 
        understand your place in this very moment<span class='green'>.</span> Do the things that you love<span class='green'>,</span> and do the things that peak your 
        interests but do them in a productive manner<span class='green'>!</span><br><br>
        
        Thank you for checking out MataGrub<span class='green'>!</span> If you are interested in contacting me for work<span class='green'>,</span> help<span class='green'>,</span> questions<span class='green'>,</span> or to chat
